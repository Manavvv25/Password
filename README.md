Project Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning models to detect and mitigate deepfake attacks. It showcases how advanced algorithms can identify manipulated videos or images, ensuring the security and authenticity of multimedia content.

Features
Extracts features from multimedia data to detect anomalies.
Implements supervised learning for classification between real and fake content.
Visualizes detection results with accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
User-friendly interface for testing with custom media files.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Libraries:
OpenCV: For processing image and video data.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the deep learning models.
matplotlib: For visualizing metrics and results.
How to Run
Pre-requisites:

Install Python (3.6 or later).
Install the required libraries using:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras matplotlib
Run the Program:

Execute the script using:
bash
Copy code
python deepfake_detection.py
Expected Output
A terminal output summarizing the model's performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
A visualization of the confusion matrix and accuracy plot.
Detection results indicating whether the provided file is real or fake.
